This is for Task 15: Lambda and Keyword Argument Magic

Write a function that returns a list of n functions, such that each one,
when called, will return the input value, incremented by an increasing number.

Use a for loop, a lambda, and a keyword argument

( Extra credit ): Do it with a list comprehension, instead of a for loop
