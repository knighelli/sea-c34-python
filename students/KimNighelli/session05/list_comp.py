This is for Task 13- List Comprehensions

The first part of this assignment was to take an online quiz in Canvas,
which I have already completed. Please see the quiz "Comprehension
Comprehension"

The task had the following instruction: Return the number of even ints in
the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder,
e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.

Below is the function doing that.
